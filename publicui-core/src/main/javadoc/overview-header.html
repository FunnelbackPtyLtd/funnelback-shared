<h1>Funnelback data model documentation.</h1>

<p>
	The data model is the in-memory structure holding the information about a search being performed. 
	Please consult the main documentation <a href="../more/extra/data_model.html">page about the Data Model</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>It contains 3 main objects which can be found under the <a href="com/funnelback/publicui/search/model/transaction/SearchTransaction.html">SearchTransaction</a> class:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A <a href="com/funnelback/publicui/search/model/transaction/SearchQuestion.html">question</a> containing the input parameters,</li>
	<li>A <a href="com/funnelback/publicui/search/model/transaction/SearchResponse.html">response</a> containing the results,</li>
	<li>An <a href="com/funnelback/publicui/search/model/transaction/SearchError.html">error</a>, if the search was unsuccessful.</li>
</ul>
